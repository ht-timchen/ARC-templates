<div>
	<h4><strong>The rejoinder process</strong></h4>
</div>

<p>During <a href="file:///C:/Users/uqknunes/Downloads/presentation_arc_assessment_processes_lockeddown.pdf">the ARC Assessment cycle</a>&nbsp; your application will be assigned to two types of assessors:</p>

<p style="margin-left:35.45pt;">Type 1.at least two, but up to five, Detailed assessors</p>

<p style="margin-left:35.45pt;">Type 2.at least two General assessors (usually College of Experts members)</p>

<p>The Detailed assessors, who are drawn from the Australian (~75%) and international (~25%) research community&nbsp;complete in-depth assessments of proposals and provide scores and comments against the scheme specific selection criteria. These Detailed assessments are then sent to you (the applicant) so that you have the opportunity to respond. &nbsp;You will not receive the scores, just the comments, and your rejoinders will<strong> not be viewed by the Detailed assessors</strong> but will be considered by the General assessors<strong>. </strong>The General assessors, will read your application, the detailed assessments and your rejoinder as a package.</p>

<p>Therefore your rejoinder can help you mitigate a poor score from a detailed assessor, if you are able to convincingly argue that the reasoning for that score is unjustified. By the same token, if your reviews are all good, but not necessarily excellent, then the rejoinder process provides an opportunity to present a clear and sustained argument on the quality of the project, personnel and its significance. &nbsp;The General assessors then confer with each other to finalise scores before submitting them and ranks for all the proposals they have to read. Proposals are then ranked within the discipline panel (where relevant—some schemes have a single panel).</p>

<p>What this process tells us, is that when you write your rejoinder, you need to consider the General assessors as your audience. So you need to frame your arguments accordingly. Consequently, it’s important to carefully consider how you can make your rejoinder as effective and easy to comprehend for two people who may have to asses fifty or more applications in a short amount of time. To do this you need to consider:</p>

<ul>
	<li>What the key points are that need to be either highlighted or addressed</li>
	<li>How you structure your response</li>
	<li>The tone of your arguments</li>
	<li>The clarity of your prose</li>
	<li>Providing evidenced based arguments</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div>
	<h4>Identify the key issues</h4>
</div>

<p>The ARC give you 5000 characters (including spaces) to respond to comments. Therefore, identifying the key points that you need to address is really important. There are many ways to approach this, but the most important point is to do it objectively, as it is all too easy to react to negative comments. Asking someone else to also read the assessments or putting them aside for a day can be useful strategies.</p>

<p>When you read your assessments you should consider the relative importance of the issues that have been identified. Some will be vital to address because they reflect on the selection criteria, but others may be minor or petty. The ARC produces <a href="https://www.arc.gov.au/assessor-resources">Assessor Handbooks</a> for their schemes which include Selection Criteria and Rating Scales. Read them as they will help you identify the critical points to address.</p>

<p>As well as mapping out and weighting the issues raised, it’s valuable to look at the positive comments to see if there are any that may provide evidence to help refute negative claims. Don’t collect superlatives, look for clear arguments that can help your case. Also, don’t be tempted to be dismissive of a reviewer if they are the only non-conforming view. They may be the leading expert in your field so their opinion may carry more weight with the panel than the other assessments. Revisit your grant application and look for the evidence that may help you counter negative assertions, because the key to building your arguments is to gather proof that will allow the panel to negate the negative reviews. If you can provide references to published work by yourself or others that refutes a negative comment, then this is helpful. The panel expects that applicants will disagree with negative comments, but to convince the panel you have to provide some evidence or logical argument (or both). Just be careful to stay within the <a href="https://www.arc.gov.au/grants/grant-application/rejoinders">ARC guidelines for rejoinders</a> – if in doubt contact the research office.</p>

<p>Whilst it would be lovely to be able to dismiss all the negatives raised, sometimes, the reviewer is going to make a valid point. Think through carefully how you can take ownership of the issue so that it can be used to improve the project.</p>

<p>One word of caution, sometimes assessors comment on irrelevant points. The points can be irrelevant as a result of misunderstanding about the project scope or because they are vague in nature. If they concern matters not within the bounds of the project then make sure you clearly identify that for the General Assessor. If there are general comments or criticisms that don’t relate to the assessment criteria, consider carefully whether they need to be addressed. In all cases try not to be dismissive of the concern, rather demonstrate that is not relevant to the application.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div>
	<h4>How will you structure your document?</h4>
</div>

<p>There are a few ways to structure your response, the two most popular are:</p>

<p><strong>By Assessor:</strong> Answering each assessor’s comments in turn is a straightforward approach and one that is quite easy to write and follow. The downside is that it can be repetitive and if there are many assessors, it can be difficult to keep within character limits. You also need to consider how you might use one assessor’s positive assessment to counteract another’s criticism. A word of caution, often when responding to each assessor, it is easy to fall into the pattern of only addressing the criticisms, without acknowledging the positive aspects of the work.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>By Criteria:</strong> In this method the applicant responds to the assessor’s comments grouped by assessment criteria such as the Candidate, the Project Quality and Innovation, Feasibility etc. This approach has several advantages:</p>

<ul>
	<li>It avoids repetition if there is an overlap on comments</li>
	<li>It can be helpful to use evidence from a positive assessment to defend against a negative one</li>
	<li>It provides the General Assessor with a document consistent with the arrangement of the assessor reports.</li>
	<li>It allows consideration of the relative importance of assessors’ comments.</li>
</ul>

<p>If using this approach, you will need to think about how you will manage comments that have been incorrectly included against criteria. For example, an assessor may comment on the innovation of the project in the feasibility section or discuss track record in the innovation section.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div>
	<h4>Tips to make it accessible and engaging</h4>
</div>

<p>Whatever you write, you should always consider your audience, which (in this case) will be the General Assessors. Given that they will have a limited amount of time, the most important consideration is ensuring your rejoinder is clear and concise.</p>

<p>There are a number of small ways that you can do this:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Help your assessor identify relevant information
		<ul>
			<li>When referencing back to the application, say “on page 5, the table shows…” do not say “as per our application we showed…”</li>
			<li>When referring to papers in your bibliography, say “in publication #10” not “the literature indicates”</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Don’t feel that you have to use all your character allowance (shorter is often better).</li>
	<li>Where applicable, use the <a href="https://blog.globalacademyjobs.com/proposal-writing-assert-and-justify-style/">‘assert-justify’</a> approach to writing – that is state your claim (or rebut) then provide the evidence to back it up. Don’t make the reader work hard to understand the point you are making.</li>
	<li>Provide well thought out solutions to any problems that have been identified.</li>
	<li>Avoid emotive language – stick to the facts and use an objective tone.</li>
	<li>Acknowledge any misunderstandings.</li>
	<li>Address criticisms directly.</li>
	<li>One point per sentence.</li>
	<li>Minimise the number of acronyms, technical terms and jargon you use.</li>
	<li>Keep your paragraphs short</li>
	<li>Keep punctuation simple.</li>
	<li>Ask an experienced colleague to read your response.</li>
	<li>Get someone to proof read your work for grammar and spelling.</li>
</ul>
